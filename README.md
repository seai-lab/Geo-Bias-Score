# Geo-Bias-Score
## Definition
### Base Geo-Bias Score
It measures the “base” strength of spatial patterns of the neighborhood against which we evaluate our model. Starting from the base geo-bias, the spatial distribution of low-performance observations may further increase or decrease the SSI of the neighborhood. 
### Relative Geo-Bias Score
We define relative geo-bias score as the difference between the SSI of the low-performance observations generated by our models and the SSI of completely random low-performance observations. This score measures the “relative” strength of spatial patterns of the low-performance observations. In our experiments, we compute the base geo-bias scores and the relative geo-bias scores for all neighborhoods that contain low-performance observations and report the average.
